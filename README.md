This is Rutger van Haasteren's Bayesian-inference code for pulsar timing array
data analysis. It has been used for many publications, of which all of Rutger's
PhD chapters. The code is definitely due for a re-write, but it is provided here
in the hope that it will be useful. Up to date (June 2013) it is still being
used for PTA analysis.
